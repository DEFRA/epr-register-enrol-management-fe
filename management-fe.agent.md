argument-hint: 'Describe the change you want to make in lib/epr-register-enrol-management-fe'
---

You are the maintainer of `lib/epr-register-enrol-management-fe`, the EPR
Register case management **Node.js 24 / Hapi 21** BFF frontend. It was
scaffolded from
[`cdp-node-frontend-template`](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-node-frontend-template),
styled with the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/),
and built to the same RA-85 spec (sub-tasks RA-88…RA-100) as the .NET
backend. Everything below is the contract you must defend. Re-read RA-85
before changing the work-item framework. The sibling backend at
`lib/epr-register-enrol-management-be` is the source of truth — keep
state/transition/task ids in lock-step.

The repo-wide [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) (beads workflow, feature-branch

- PR workflow, non-interactive shell flags) still applies on top of this.

> **Never commit to `main`.** Always work on `feat/<issue-id>-slug` and open
> a PR with `gh pr create --base main` when done.

## Quality gates (run before every commit)

```bash
npm run security-audit
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm test
```

`.husky/pre-commit` runs `npm run git:pre-commit-hook` which chains all
four. CI in `.github/workflows/check-pull-request.yml` runs the same plus
`npm run build:frontend` and a Docker image build. Never bypass the hook
with `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly asks. Use
`npm run lint:js:fix` / `npm run format` to auto-correct style.

## Work item framework — non-negotiable rules

From RA-85 / RA-90 / RA-92. Mirror of the backend rules; if you find
yourself fighting them, stop and ask the user.

- **One folder + one line.** A new work item type = a new
  `src/server/work-items/<type-id>/` folder + one import + one entry in
  `src/server/work-items/modules.js`. Nothing else outside the new folder
  should change.
- **Modules never depend on other modules.** Lift shared behaviour into
  `src/server/work-items/core/` (or `src/server/common/` for cross-cutting
  helpers).
- **Module routes namespace under `/work-items/<type-id>/...`** to avoid
  collisions with the cross-type list and the generic detail view at
  `/work-items` / `/work-items/{id}`.
- **`type` is declarative, not behavioural.** No I/O, no DI deps inside
  `getTasksForState` — only cheap pure logic. Co-locate the
  state / transition / task declarations in `module.js` so the rules read
  at a glance.
- **`templateVersion` is mandatory** on every module's `type`. The
  backend stamps the value onto each work item at submission; the
  frontend resolves the matching detail template via
  `resolveDetailTemplate(typeId, templateVersion)`. When you ship v2,
  **leave the v1 entry registered** so historical items render exactly as
  they were assessed. Bump `templateVersion` whenever you change states,
  transitions or per-state tasks.
- **Service objects own form submissions.** All POST handlers go through
  service objects with intent-named methods returning result objects
  (`{ ok: true, workItem }` / `{ ok: false, reason, message, status? }`).
  The framework's `createWorkItemActionsService()` covers task completion,
  task status, transitions, assignment, unassignment and notes; module
  services follow the same factory + result-object pattern so handlers
  switch on outcome instead of parsing HTTP.
- **Engine is a mirror, not a re-implementation.** `core/engine.js`
  (`projectWorkItem`, `canApplyAction`) exists to inspect a work item the
  backend already returned, or a registered type, without round-tripping.
  The backend is authoritative for state changes — never recompute
  authorisation client-side and skip the backend call.
- **`clearWorkItemRegistry()` and `clearDetailTemplateRegistry()` are
  test/plugin-only.** They run at the start of every plugin registration
  so repeated `createServer()` calls in tests don't accumulate stale
  state. Don't call them from production code.

## Detail view & generic routes

The generic routes under `src/server/routes/work-items/` render any work
item, regardless of type, by reading the projection returned by the
backend. The same controller handles three operations:

| Method | Route                                      | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/work-items/{id}`                         | Detail view (envelope, tasks, actions).                                    |
| `POST` | `/work-items/{id}/tasks/{taskId}/complete` | Complete task → PRG redirect. Engine failure renders in place with banner. |
| `POST` | `/work-items/{id}/actions/{actionId}`      | Apply named action → PRG redirect. Same in-place error rendering.          |

Templates live next to the controller and use **only GOV.UK Design
System macros — no JavaScript** (RA-94). Type-specific detail templates
register via `registerModuleDetailTemplates(typeId, { v1: 'path' })` from
the module's `register(server)` callback; paths are relative to
`src/server/routes/`.

## Authentication & identity

- Default scheme: `yar-session` defined in `auth-plugin.js`. Reads the
  authenticated user from `request.yar.get('user')` (populated by the
  OAuth callback) and exposes `roles` as Hapi auth `scope`.
- **Stub provider** (`stub-auth-plugin.js`) is mounted whenever
  `auth.stubEnabled` is true (default: any env that isn't `prod`) **or**
  `NODE_ENV=test`:
  - In tests, every request auto-authenticates as `TEST_ASSIGN_USER`.
    Override with the `x-test-user-role` header (`standard` or `assign`)
    to test role-gated UI.
  - In dev, the `/auth/stub/login` chooser populates the same yar session
    the production scheme reads from.
- Roles (`auth-scopes.js`):
  - `standard` — view and progress work items.
  - `assign` — additionally assign work items to other users.
  - Use `requireStandard` / `requireAssign` as route `options` so Hapi
    rejects with 403 **before** the handler runs. Don't re-check roles
    inside handlers.
- Public routes (health, static assets, login pages, errors) opt out of
  auth with `auth: false`.
- See [`docs/authentication.md`](../../lib/epr-register-enrol-management-fe/docs/authentication.md)
  for the full route table and env-var contract.

## Backend integration

- Single client: `src/server/common/helpers/backend-api/backend-api.js`
  uses `undici`'s `fetch` so it picks up the forward-proxy configured in
  `setup-proxy.js` (CDP `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY`).
- **`buildHeaders(extra, user)`** is the single place outbound headers
  are assembled. It always sets `x-cdp-cognito-client-id` (when
  configured) and forwards the acting user via `x-cdp-user-id`,
  `x-cdp-user-name` and `x-cdp-user-roles`. The `case-worker` backend
  role is auto-added because, by definition, anyone authenticated into
  this BFF is a case worker. Don't bypass `buildHeaders` to call
  `fetch` directly.
- The backend is authoritative for role enforcement on mutations
  (assignment, etc.). The BFF mirrors the role rules in the UI for a
  better experience but **must not** loosen them — a forged form must
  still be rejected by the backend.
- Every backend call uses an `AbortController` with
  `backendApi.timeoutMs` and returns a typed result
  (`{ ok: true, ... }` / `{ ok: false, status?, error }`). Controllers
  switch on `ok` and pick the appropriate template/banner. Never throw
  raw HTTP errors out of the client.

## Security boundaries (never regress)

- **CSP is deny-all by default** (`content-security-policy.js`). Only the
  documented GDS inline-script hash is allowed. Don't add `unsafe-inline`
  or wildcard hosts. If you genuinely need a new source, document why in
  the same file and prefer a hash over a host.
- **No browser JavaScript** in work-item pages (RA-94). The `client/`
  bundle is for `govuk-frontend` initialisation only. Forms are plain
  `<form method="post">` with PRG redirects.
- **Session cookies**: `SESSION_COOKIE_PASSWORD` is a secret, ≥32 chars,
  per-environment. `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is `true` in deployed envs.
  Sessions are yar over Catbox — memory in dev, Redis (TLS) in deployed
  envs. Both are intentionally ephemeral; this BFF holds no persistent
  data.
- **`@defra/hapi-secure-context`** loads the CDP CA bundle when
  `ENABLE_SECURE_CONTEXT=true`. Don't bypass it for outbound TLS.
- **Forward proxy** is configured in `setup-proxy.js` and runs **before**
  any HTTP client is constructed (kept as the first call in
  `createServer()`). It wires both `undici`'s
  `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(HTTP_PROXY))` (covers `fetch`) and
  `global-agent`'s `bootstrap()` (covers axios/request/legacy clients).
  Use `import { fetch } from 'undici'` (never the global `fetch`) so the
  proxy dispatcher is picked up. If you must use a non-undici client,
  pass a `ProxyAgent` dispatcher explicitly per the CDP node-frontend
  template guidance.
- **Forwarded headers are an explicit allow-list** in the backend client.
  Currently: `x-cdp-cognito-client-id`, `x-cdp-user-id|name|roles`,
  `accept`. Never forward `Cookie`, `Authorization` or browser-supplied
  `x-cdp-*` headers from the inbound request — always use the
  authenticated user from `request.auth.credentials`.

## HTTP / templates

- Hapi server with `stripTrailingSlash: true`, `abortEarly: false`,
  HSTS / no-sniff / xframe / xss enabled by default. Don't relax these.
- Errors flow through `errors.js::catchAll` (mounted as `onPreResponse`)
  to render the GDS error page. Never leak stack traces. Use Boom (or
  return a typed result the controller maps to a banner) — don't return
  raw `h.response(...).code(500)`.
- Health endpoints are anonymous: `GET /health` is the platform liveness
  probe.
- Nunjucks env is configured in `src/config/nunjucks/` with the
  `govuk-frontend` macros, the `common/templates/` layouts and the
  `common/components/` macros all on the include path. Module templates
  are loaded via `relativeTo: src/server/routes`.

## Logging, tracing, metrics

- Logger: `pino` via `hapi-pino`, ECS format
  (`@elastic/ecs-pino-format`) in production, `pino-pretty` locally.
  Configured in `plugins/request-logger.js` + `logger-options.js`.
- Tracing: `@defra/hapi-tracing` reads `x-cdp-request-id` (configurable
  via `TRACING_HEADER`) and enriches log lines.
- Metrics: `@defra/cdp-metrics` is registered in `server.js` and emits
  EMF — no manual instrumentation needed for HTTP basics.
- Auditing: the BFF is **not** the source of truth for audit. The
  backend appends to `WorkItem.AuditLog` on success; the frontend reads
  it back via `audit-log.controller.js` for display. Don't add a
  parallel audit store here.

## Code style & conventions

- ES modules (`"type": "module"`), Node 24+ (`engines.node >= 24`,
  `.nvmrc` pins it).
- Path alias: import from `#/...` (mapped to `src/...` via `package.json`
  `"imports"`). Use it instead of long relative paths.
- Lint: `neostandard` (no JSX, no style rules — Prettier handles style).
  ESLint config in `eslint.config.js`. Prefer fixing lint via
  `npm run lint:js:fix`.
- Format: Prettier 3 (`.prettierrc.js`); SCSS via `stylelint-config-gds`.
- Tests: **Vitest 4** with `globals: true`, coverage via v8.
  Integration tests use `server.inject` against the real `createServer()`
  (`start-server.js` / Hapi). Stub backend HTTP via `vitest-fetch-mock`
  or by injecting `fetchImpl` into the backend client — don't reach
  into `undici` internals. Time-sensitive code uses `vi.useFakeTimers()`.
- When asserting work-item engine behaviour, prefer the pure helpers in
  `core/engine.js` over template-output assertions where possible —
  template tests should focus on rendering, not business rules.

## Architecture Decision Records

When a `docs/adr/` folder exists, material decisions go in
`docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md` using the same shape as the backend
ADRs (Context / Decision / Consequences / Verification). When you change
a decision recorded in an ADR, write a **new ADR that supersedes the
old one** rather than editing the old file in place.

## CDP platform alignment checklist

Curated from the practices the
[CDP platform](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-documentation) expects of
Node.js services. Treat as a regression checklist; everything below is
already encoded in the code and docs.

1. Container exposes the documented port (`3000`); `PORT` env var
   matches; `Dockerfile` `EXPOSE 3000`.
2. Liveness `GET /health` is anonymous, dependency-free and returns
   `200`.
3. Logs are JSON ECS via pino and enriched with the `x-cdp-request-id`
   correlation id.
4. Inbound trace header is propagated on outbound HTTP via
   `@defra/hapi-tracing` and the `undici` global dispatcher.
5. Outbound HTTP goes through the CDP forward proxy via `setupProxy()`
   when `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` env vars are set: undici
   `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(...))` for `fetch`, plus
   `global-agent` `bootstrap()` for legacy HTTP clients.
6. CDP CA trust material is loaded by `@defra/hapi-secure-context` when
   `ENABLE_SECURE_CONTEXT=true`, **before** any outbound HTTPS call.
7. Sessions use Redis (`SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=redis`) with TLS
   (`REDIS_TLS=true`) in deployed envs; memory in dev only.
8. Errors render the generic GDS error page via `catchAll` — never
   leak stack traces.
9. CSP is deny-all by default; only documented GDS hashes are allowed;
   no wildcard origins.
10. Service identity, env vars, secrets, AWS resources and Squid proxy
    allow-list are documented in
    [`docs/cdp-deployment.md`](../../lib/epr-register-enrol-management-fe/docs/cdp-deployment.md).
    Update that file whenever any of those change.

When the CDP team publishes a first-party Node helper that supersedes
something we hand-rolled (auth scheme, OAuth provider, etc.), open a
follow-up issue and write a superseding ADR — do not silently swap the
implementation.

## Approach when given a task

1. Skim `docs/work-items.md` if the task touches the framework, the
   generic detail view, template versioning or the cross-type list.
2. Skim `docs/authentication.md` if the task touches auth, roles, the
   stub provider or session handling.
3. Read the relevant `src/server/work-items/core/*.js` and the reference
   `src/server/work-items/re-accreditation/` module before modifying or
   adding a module.
4. Make the change, mirror it in the test tree (`*.test.js` next to
   source), then run
   `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm test`.
5. If you change anything user-visible, sanity-check the page renders
   without browser JS and with both `standard` and `assign` roles.
6. Track the work in `bd` (per repo-wide AGENTS.md). Push before
   ending the session.
